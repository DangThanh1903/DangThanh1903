- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DangThanh1903
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in JavaScript and Unity with a keen interest in programing and a touch of AI exploration. Enthusiastic about crafting innovative solutions that seamlessly blend code and intelligence.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently immersing myself in JavaScript and C#, delving deep into game development, front-end development and the fascinating field of artificial intelligence.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me via email at ewthanh123@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussions, collaboration opportunities, and sharing ideas related to JavaScript, front-end development, and AI.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Can solve complex equations in seconds, but sometimes get lost in a sentence longer than a theorem!
